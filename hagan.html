        <p>My name is Alberta Hagan</p>
        <p>I was born in 29th May 2003 in Mankessim in the Central Region of Ghana</p>
        <p>I started schooling at Mankessim M/A Basic School and further my education to Obama College in the year 2021
        </p>
        <p>After secondary school,i started a small business to save money to further education
        </p>
        <p>Three(3) years later which is 2025,i was able to make some amount of money to go to the tertiary with the support of my parent</p>
        <p>I bought KNUST forms because it is the best University in West Afica to read Engineering and God willing i had my first choice which is Computer Engineering</p>
        <p>I want to read Computer Engineering because i am intrigued by how computer work,and enjoy learning about hardware,software and networking</p>
        <p>And currently i am in KNUST reading Computer Engineering by the Grace of God</p>
